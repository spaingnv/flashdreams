**FlashDreams** is a high-performance inference and serving library for
interactive autoregressive video and world models. It began as the optimized
runtime behind the [NVIDIA OmniDreams closed-loop demo for GTC 2026][omnidreams-blog]
and has grown into a general platform for real-time world-model applications
across gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, simulated or virtual
environments, and more.

## System Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with **80 GB VRAM or more** (e.g. H100 80GB), see notes below.
- NVIDIA driver from the **R580 series or newer** (default compatible with CUDA 13.x)
- **CUDA 13.x by default** (PyTorch `2.11.0+cu130` and the `nvidia-*-cu13` libraries are
  resolved by `uv sync`. A system CUDA toolkit is needed only for the
  developer extras and is included in `nvidia/cuda:13.2.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu24.04`)
- **Python >= 3.10**
- **PyTorch >= 2.11.0+cu130** (`>= 2.9` for bare PyPI library install)
- Linux x86-64 or arm64
- **100 GB+ free storage space** recommended for environment and model checkpoints.
- Docker with the
  [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
  (optional, only for the container workflow)

> Development and testing were performed on GPUs with **80 GB of VRAM or more**.
> Inference can fail (out-of-memory) on consumer and even enthusiast GPUs.
> Per-model GPU and VRAM requirements are listed on each model page in
> [the model gallery](https://nvidia.github.io/flashdreams/main/models/index.html).

## Quickstart

The complete setup is in
[the installation guide](https://nvidia.github.io/flashdreams/main/quickstart/index.html#install).
Assuming `uv` is [installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation), the shortest viable path is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git
cd flashdreams
uv sync --extra runners
export HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-token>
uv run flashdreams-run --help
```

Note for developers/maintainers you would want to run `uv sync --extra dev --extra runners` instead.

### Select CUDA Version

FlashDreams defaults to the CUDA 13 PyTorch stack (the `cuda13` dependency
group is activated automatically via `default-groups`):

- **Linux:** `uv sync` pulls `torch>=2.9` from PyPI, whose Linux wheels are
  the CUDA 13 build (the `+cu130` local-version tag is just stripped on
  PyPI).
- **Windows:** `uv sync` pulls torch from NVIDIA's `cu130` index
  (`https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130`) — PyPI's Windows torch wheel
  is CPU-only.

CUDA 12.8 is available as an opt-in side profile (Linux only) via the
`cuda12` dependency group:

```bash
uv sync --group cuda12 --extra runners
```

The two groups are declared mutually exclusive in `pyproject.toml`, so uv
deactivates the default `cuda13` group automatically when `--group cuda12`
is passed.

Then launch your first model by following [the Get Started guide](https://nvidia.github.io/flashdreams/main/quickstart/index.html#run-your-first-model).
For example, the Self-Forcing T2V v2 application is:

```bash
uv run --project integrations_v2/self_forcing \
    flashdreams-run-v2 t2v-self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b \
    --output-path artifacts/t2v-self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b.mp4 -- \
    --prompt "A cat surfing." --total-blocks 7
```

You can also install FlashDreams as a library from PyPI:

```bash
pip install flashdreams
```

### Try the interactive driving demo

Drive a world model in real time with the unified OmniDreams `local-window` or
`webrtc` launch mode. See the
**[interactive demo guide](https://nvidia.github.io/flashdreams/main/models/omnidreams.html#launch-the-interactive-demo)**.

## Supported models

FlashDreams ships first-party integrations under
[`integrations_v2/`](integrations_v2/). Each model has a dedicated docs page with
runner slugs, multi-GPU commands, and (where available) profiling benchmarks.
