# flashdreams.accelerated

`flashdreams.accelerated` is a low-level acceleration library used by
FlashDreams to build high-performance modules for streaming video models. It
currently contains two components:

- Quantization Toolkit
- Optimized Multi Head Attention

In the future, `flashdreams.accelerated` should be refactored into
`flashdreams.core` alongside CUDA graph capture, context parallelism,
disaggregated execution, additional low-level optimized kernels such as the
optimized multi-head attention implementation, and a possible autotuning
system. These building blocks will help FlashDreams achieve speed-of-light
performance across different platforms.

## Quantization Toolkit

The toolkit currently has two features:

- **Accelerated quantizer for tensor quantize and dequantize**
- **Quantized linear layer**

### Accelerated Quantizer

`quantize` quantizes a tensor to a specified dtype and scale granularity.

#### Target Dtype

The supported target dtypes/formats are `torch.float8_e4m3fn`,
`torch.float8_e5m2`, and `torch.int8`.

For example, consider the floating-point vector

$$
x = [0.42, 0.37, -0.67].
$$

For INT8, $M_{\mathrm{int8}} = 127$. Using one scale and rounding the scaled
values to the nearest integers gives

$$
s = \frac{0.67}{127} \approx 0.005276, \qquad
\bar{x} = \mathrm{round}(x / s) = [80, 70, -127].
$$

The quantized vector is therefore $[80, 70, -127]$ with scale
$s \approx 0.005276$.

#### Scale Granularity

For an input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times D}$ and a target dtype $t$,
let $M_t$ be the largest finite positive value that $t$ can represent and let
$\epsilon$ be a small positive scale floor.

Per-tensor granularity computes one scale for the complete matrix:

$$
s_{\text{tensor}} =
\max\left(\frac{\max_{i,j}|X_{ij}|}{M_t}, \epsilon\right).
$$

Every element is divided by $s_{\text{tensor}}$ before it is clipped to
$[-M_t, M_t]$ and converted to $t$.

```{figure} /_static/diagrams/accelerated/tensor-wise-quantization.svg
:alt: Tensor-wise quantization applies one shared scale to the complete tensor.
:align: center
:width: 100%

Tensor-wise quantization applies one shared scale to the complete tensor.
```

Per-slice granularity computes a scale for every slice along the selected
axis. For a matrix, `axis=0` reduces across rows and produces one scale per
column, while `axis=1` reduces across columns and produces one scale per row:

$$
s_j^{(\text{axis}=0)} =
\max\left(\frac{\max_i|X_{ij}|}{M_t}, \epsilon\right), \qquad
s_i^{(\text{axis}=1)} =
\max\left(\frac{\max_j|X_{ij}|}{M_t}, \epsilon\right).
$$

Thus, `axis=0` divides each $X_{ij}$ by its column scale $s_j$, and `axis=1`
divides it by its row scale $s_i$.

```{figure} /_static/diagrams/accelerated/slice-wise-quantization-axis0.svg
:alt: Slice-wise quantization along axis zero applies one scale to each column.
:align: center
:width: 100%

Slice-wise quantization with `axis=0` applies one scale to each column.
```

```{figure} /_static/diagrams/accelerated/slice-wise-quantization-axis1.svg
:alt: Slice-wise quantization along axis one applies one scale to each row.
:align: center
:width: 100%

Slice-wise quantization with `axis=1` applies one scale to each row.
```

Using the same vector as the first column of a $(3, 2)$ matrix and adding a
second column gives

$$
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
0.42 & 0.12 \\
0.37 & -0.91 \\
-0.67 & 0.55
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

**Per tensor.** One scale covers all six elements:

$$
s_{\mathrm{tensor}} = \frac{0.91}{127} \approx 0.007165, \qquad
\bar{X}_{\mathrm{tensor}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
59 & 17 \\
52 & -127 \\
-94 & 77
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

**Per slice with `axis=0`.** Reducing across the three rows produces one scale
for each of the two columns:

$$
s^{(\mathrm{axis}=0)} =
\begin{bmatrix}0.67 / 127 & 0.91 / 127\end{bmatrix}
\approx
\begin{bmatrix}0.005276 & 0.007165\end{bmatrix}, \qquad
\bar{X}^{(\mathrm{axis}=0)} =
\begin{bmatrix}
80 & 17 \\
70 & -127 \\
-127 & 77
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

**Per slice with `axis=1`.** Reducing across the two columns produces one scale
for each of the three rows:

$$
s^{(\mathrm{axis}=1)} =
\begin{bmatrix}
0.42 / 127 \\
0.91 / 127 \\
0.67 / 127
\end{bmatrix}
\approx
\begin{bmatrix}
0.003307 \\
0.007165 \\
0.005276
\end{bmatrix}, \qquad
\bar{X}^{(\mathrm{axis}=1)} =
\begin{bmatrix}
127 & 36 \\
52 & -127 \\
-127 & 104
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

:alt: Tile-wise quantization applies a separate scale to each tensor tile.
:align: center
:width: 100%

Tile-wise quantization applies a separate scale to each tile and is planned for a future version.
```

CUDA tensors use the Triton implementation by default; CPU tensors use the
Torch implementation. The quantizer performs scale computation in detached
FP32 values. The returned scale tensor is FP32 and retains all input
dimensions, with reduced dimensions kept at size one.

`dequantize` casts $\bar X$ to the first scale's dtype and applies every
provided scale in order with normal tensor broadcasting:

$$
X = \mathrm{dequantize}\left(\bar X, s^{(1)}, \ldots, s^{(m)}\right)
\approx \bar X \odot \prod_{r=1}^{m}s^{(r)}.
$$

For example, the INT8 vector and scale from the earlier example are

$$
\bar{x} = [80, 70, -127], \qquad
s = \frac{0.67}{127} \approx 0.005276.
$$

Dequantization multiplies every quantized value by the scale:

$$
\hat{x} = \bar{x}s
= [80s, 70s, -127s]
\approx [0.4220, 0.3693, -0.6700].
$$

The result approximates the original vector $[0.42, 0.37, -0.67]$. The small
difference in the first two values comes from rounding during INT8
quantization.

It then casts the result to the requested output dtype (FP16 by default). With
no scales, it directly casts $\bar X$ to that dtype. This supports, for
example, separately applying activation and weight scales after a GEMM.

#### Quantized GEMM

For a quantized-GEMM example, let $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times D}$ and
$K \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times D}$ be token-major query and key matrices,
with $L$ query tokens, $S$ key tokens, and feature width $D$. Their
full-precision score matrix is $QK^\mathsf{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times S}$.
With tensorwise quantization, scalar scales $s_Q$ and $s_K$, and quantized
matrices $\bar Q$ and $\bar K$, the scaled product is

$$
QK^\mathsf{T} \approx (s_Qs_K)\,(\bar Q\bar K^\mathsf{T}).
$$

```{figure} /_static/diagrams/accelerated/tensor-tensor-quantized-gemm.svg
:alt: Tensor-tensor quantized GEMM applies the two tensor scales to the quantized matrix product.
:align: center
:width: 100%

Tensor–tensor quantized GEMM combines the two scalar scales.
```

With `Granularity.SLICE` and `axis=-1`, each token instead has a scale:
$s_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times 1}$ and
$s_K \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times 1}$. The corresponding per-token result is

$$
QK^\mathsf{T} \approx
\left(s_Qs_K^\mathsf{T}\right) \odot
\left(\bar Q\bar K^\mathsf{T}\right),
$$

where $s_Qs_K^\mathsf{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times S}$ is the outer product
of the query and key token scales and $\odot$ is elementwise multiplication.
These equations describe composing the tensor quantizer with a GEMM; the
quantizer itself does not perform attention or provide a fused QK kernel.

```

#### Worked Slice-Quantized GEMM

This example quantizes $A$ per row and $B$ per column, accumulates their GEMM
in INT32, and dequantizes the result with both scale tensors:

```python
import torch

from flashdreams.accelerated.quantization.quantizer import (
    Granularity,
    dequantize,
    quantize,
)

a = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])
# a: shape=(3, 2), dtype=torch.float32
b = torch.tensor([[7.0, 8.0, 9.0], [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]])
# b: shape=(2, 3), dtype=torch.float32

quantized_a, scale_a = quantize(
    a, torch.int8, Granularity.SLICE, axis=1
)
# quantized_a: shape=(3, 2), dtype=torch.int8
# scale_a: shape=(3, 1), dtype=torch.float32
quantized_b, scale_b = quantize(
    b, torch.int8, Granularity.SLICE, axis=0
)
# quantized_b: shape=(2, 3), dtype=torch.int8
# scale_b: shape=(1, 3), dtype=torch.float32

# Accumulate in INT32 so the INT8 products do not overflow.
quantized_c = torch._int_mm(quantized_a, quantized_b)
# quantized_c: shape=(3, 3), dtype=torch.int32
c = dequantize(
    quantized_c, scale_a, scale_b, dtype=torch.float32
)
# c: shape=(3, 3), dtype=torch.float32
reference_c = a @ b
# reference_c: shape=(3, 3), dtype=torch.float32

assert quantized_a.tolist() == [[64, 127], [95, 127], [106, 127]]
assert quantized_b.tolist() == [[89, 92, 95], [127, 127, 127]]
assert quantized_c.tolist() == [
    [21825, 22017, 22209],
    [24584, 24869, 25154],
    [25563, 25881, 26199],
]
assert scale_a.shape == (3, 1)  # One scale per row of A.
assert scale_b.shape == (1, 3)  # One scale per column of B.

torch.testing.assert_close(c, reference_c, rtol=0, atol=0.2)
print(c)
# tensor([[ 27.0631,  30.0312,  33.0471],
#         [ 60.9684,  67.8428,  74.8585],
#         [ 95.0946, 105.9053, 116.9526]])
```

Passing `scale_a` and `scale_b` separately to `dequantize` applies them with
normal broadcasting, combining each row scale from $A$ with each column scale
from $B$ without materializing their outer product.

### Quantized Linear Layer

`QuantizedNonPersistentLinear` constructs an inference projection from existing
weight $W \in \mathbb{R}^{O \times I}$ and optional bias
$b \in \mathbb{R}^{O}$. It keeps the derived quantized weight, bias, and
FP32 weight scale as nonpersistent buffers, so callers rebuild them from
checkpoint tensors rather than loading them from `state_dict`.

`WeightGranularity.PER_OUT_CHANNEL` quantizes each weight row with
`Granularity.SLICE` and `axis=-1`, giving a weight scale shaped $[O, 1]$.
`WeightGranularity.TENSOR` gives one $[1, 1]$ scale for all weights. The
supported weight granularities are deliberately limited to per-output-channel
and per-tensor quantization by the inner-dimension rule described above. In
$XW^\mathsf{T}$, the input dimension $I$ is the GEMM reduction dimension.
Per-output-channel scales and a tensorwise scale remain constant across $I$
and can therefore be applied after GEMM. A per-input-channel scale would vary
across $I$, so it would have to remain inside the reduction and could not be
applied as a single post-GEMM scale. The layer accepts the same quantized
dtypes as the quantizer.

For activations $X \in \mathbb{R}^{\ldots \times I}$, inference has two
paths. Passing a `Granularity` dynamically quantizes $X$ with `axis=-1`.
Passing prequantized $\bar X$ instead requires the layer's activation dtype
and an FP32 tensorwise scale shaped $[1, \ldots, 1]$ or slice scale shaped
$[\ldots, 1]$. After flattening leading dimensions into GEMM rows, both
paths compute the scaled projection

$$
Y \approx (\bar X\bar W^\mathsf{T}) \odot
\left(S_XS_W^\mathsf{T}\right) + b,
$$

where $S_X$ broadcasts down output rows and $S_W^\mathsf{T}$ broadcasts
across output columns. `int8` uses an integer GEMM followed by application of
the activation and weight scales; FP8 uses scaled GEMM with those same scales.
The result is returned as `out_dtype` (FP16 by default), including after any
internal BF16 FP8 rowwise GEMM result is cast, and the optional bias is applied
in that output dtype.

(quantized-forward-example)=
#### Quantized Forward Example

The layer can quantize a full-precision input during `forward`, or reuse an
input that was quantized beforehand:

```python
import torch

from flashdreams.accelerated.quantization.linear import (
    QuantizedNonPersistentLinear,
    WeightGranularity,
)
from flashdreams.accelerated.quantization.quantizer import Granularity, quantize

weight = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])
layer = QuantizedNonPersistentLinear(
    weight,
    bias=None,
    granularity=WeightGranularity.PER_OUT_CHANNEL,
    dtype=torch.int8,
)
x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])

# Quantize full-precision x inside the forward call.
dynamic_output = layer(x, Granularity.SLICE, out_dtype=torch.float32)
# dynamic_output: shape=(2, 3), dtype=torch.float32

# Quantize x once, then reuse it for the prequantized forward path.
quantized_x, x_scale = quantize(
    x, layer.dtype, Granularity.SLICE, axis=-1
)
# quantized_x: shape=(2, 2), dtype=torch.int8
# x_scale: shape=(2, 1), dtype=torch.float32
prequantized_output = layer(
    quantized_x, x_scale, out_dtype=torch.float32
)
# prequantized_output: shape=(2, 3), dtype=torch.float32

torch.testing.assert_close(dynamic_output, prequantized_output, rtol=0, atol=0)
```

The prequantized path is useful when several projections consume the same
input. For example, the Q, K, and V projections in self-attention all consume
the same $x$, so its quantized tensor and scale can be shared across those
forward calls.

## Optimized Multi Head Attention

### Multi Head Attention Definition

Let query tokens be $X \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L \times C_Q}$ and
context tokens be $C \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times S \times C_K}$, where
$B$ is the flattened leading batch/group size, $L$ the query length,
$S$ the context length, $H$ the number of heads, and $d$ the head
dimension. With inner width $Hd$, the projections are

$$
Q = \mathrm{reshape}(XW_Q + b_Q), \qquad
K = \mathrm{reshape}(CW_K + b_K), \qquad
V = \mathrm{reshape}(CW_V + b_V),
$$

where each reshaped tensor has shape $[B, L, H, d]$ for $Q$ or
$[B, S, H, d]$ for $K$ and $V$.

Optional Q/K RMS normalization maps a feature vector
$z \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ to

$$
\mathrm{RMSNorm}_{\gamma}(z)
= \gamma \odot
\frac{z}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}z_i^2 + \epsilon}},
$$

where $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the learned elementwise weight. With
head-scoped normalization, $m=d$ and each head is normalized independently.
With inner-scoped normalization, $m=Hd$ and all heads for a token are
normalized together. No normalization leaves Q and K unchanged. Let
$Q^{(n)}$ and $K^{(n)}$ denote the resulting tensors; V is never normalized.

```{figure} /_static/diagrams/accelerated/per-head-rms-norm.svg
:alt: Head-scoped RMSNorm normalizes every attention head independently.
:align: center
:width: 100%

:alt: Inner-scoped RMSNorm normalizes all attention heads for a token together.
:align: center
:width: 100%

Inner-scoped RMSNorm normalizes the complete projected inner dimension with $m=Hd$.
```

For even $d$, RoPE starts with geometrically spaced inverse frequencies. For
a one-dimensional position and base $\Theta$ (typically $10000$), pair $r$
uses

$$
\omega_r = \Theta^{-2r/d}, \qquad
\theta_{p,r} = p\,\omega_r, \qquad 0 \le r < d/2.
$$

Optional extrapolation changes the effective base $\Theta$. Video models can
apply the same construction independently to temporal, height, and width
coordinates, allocate feature pairs to each axis, and concatenate the resulting
angles. FlashDreams receives these expanded angles as `rope_freqs` shaped
$[L,1,1,d]$. Given angle $\theta_{p,r}$, RoPE rotates pair $r$ as

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
z'_{p,a_r} \\
z'_{p,b_r}
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta_{p,r} & -\sin\theta_{p,r} \\
\sin\theta_{p,r} & \cos\theta_{p,r}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
z_{p,a_r} \\
z_{p,b_r}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Interleaved RoPE pairs $(a_r,b_r)=(2r,2r+1)$; split-half RoPE pairs
$(a_r,b_r)=(r,r+d/2)$ for $0 \le r < d/2$. Applying these rotations to
$Q^{(n)}$ and $K^{(n)}$ gives $Q^\star$ and $K^\star$; disabling RoPE leaves
them unchanged. V is not rotated.

```{figure} /_static/diagrams/accelerated/split-vs-interleaved-rope.svg
:alt: Interleaved RoPE pairs adjacent features, while split RoPE pairs features from opposite halves.
:align: center
:width: 100%

Interleaved RoPE pairs adjacent features; split-half RoPE pairs corresponding
features from the two halves of the head dimension.
```

**Before the K/V cache update.** RoPE is applied to the current key chunk
before it is written, so the cache stores position-embedded K. At each
autoregressive step, only the new query and key chunk is rotated; older cached
keys already contain their embeddings and are reused without applying RoPE
again.

```{figure} /_static/diagrams/accelerated/rope-before-kv-cache.svg
:alt: Before-cache RoPE rotates the current key chunk before writing it to the cache.
:align: center
:width: 100%

Before-cache RoPE writes position-embedded keys to the K/V cache.
```

**After the K/V cache update.** The cache stores unrotated K. Immediately
before attention, RoPE is applied to the current query and every visible cached
key using angles for their current positions. The stored cache remains
unrotated, so visible keys are rotated again on each autoregressive step.

```{figure} /_static/diagrams/accelerated/rope-after-kv-cache.svg
:alt: After-cache RoPE rotates the query and all visible cached keys before attention.
:align: center
:width: 100%

After-cache RoPE rotates visible keys while leaving cached keys unrotated.
```

For head $h$, scaled dot-product attention is

$$
A_h = \mathrm{softmax}\left(
\frac{Q_h^\star(K_h^\star)^\mathsf{T}}{\sqrt d}
\right)V_h,
\qquad
Y = \mathrm{concat}(A_1, \ldots, A_H)W_O + b_O.
$$

Implementations own the exact normalization and RoPE operation order; the
reference below normalizes before applying RoPE as shown above.
In self-attention, $C = X$ and the current K/V chunk is written into a
rolling cache before the score calculation. In cross-attention, K/V are
precomputed from static $C$ and reused for each query.

Q/K RMSNorm scope, RoPE pairing style, and RoPE cache-update scope are
independent choices. They can be combined in any supported arrangement for
both self-attention and cross-attention. See the
[Generic Multi Head Attention Interface](#generic-multi-head-attention-interface)
for configuration details.

The following examples show self-attention with before-cache RoPE and
cross-attention with after-cache RoPE.

### Generic Multi Head Attention Interface

`AttentionConfig` describes the attention geometry through the query and
context widths, number of heads, and head dimension. It also exposes the
RMSNorm and RoPE policies. Q/K RMSNorm can be disabled, applied independently
per head, or applied across the complete projected inner dimension. RoPE can
be disabled or configured with split-half or interleaved feature pairing and
can run before or after the K/V cache update.

For example, Cosmos-Predict2.5 2B self-attention uses:

```python
from flashdreams.accelerated.multi_head_attention import (
    AttentionConfig,
    QKNormScope,
    RoPEConfig,
    RoPEScope,
    RoPEStyle,
)

cosmos_attention_config = AttentionConfig(
    query_dim=2048,
    context_dim=2048,
    n_heads=16,
    head_dim=128,
    qk_norm_scope=QKNormScope.HEAD,
    qk_norm_eps=1e-6,
    rope_config=RoPEConfig(
        style=RoPEStyle.SPLIT,
        scope=RoPEScope.BEFORE_KV_CACHE,
    ),
)
```

WAN 2.1 1.3B self-attention uses:

```python
from flashdreams.accelerated.multi_head_attention import (
    AttentionConfig,
    QKNormScope,
    RoPEConfig,
    RoPEScope,
    RoPEStyle,
)

wan_attention_config = AttentionConfig(
    query_dim=1536,
    context_dim=1536,
    n_heads=12,
    head_dim=128,
    qk_norm_scope=QKNormScope.INNER,
    qk_norm_eps=1e-6,
    rope_config=RoPEConfig(
        style=RoPEStyle.INTERLEAVED,
        scope=RoPEScope.BEFORE_KV_CACHE,
    ),
)
```

`MultiHeadAttention` is an adapter-friendly abstract interface. A concrete
implementation owns the Q, K, V, and output projection layers and the Q/K
RMSNorm modules. These modules must retain the checkpoint-native attribute
names so checkpoint loading resolves the expected parameter keys. The
implementation must also expose them through the `query_projection`,
`key_projection`, `value_projection`, `output_projection`, `query_norm`, and
`key_norm` properties required by the shared interface.

`compute_kv(context, rope_freqs)` projects a context and precomputes its K/V
cache, which is typically used to prepare static cross-attention context.
`forward(x, kv_cache, rope_freqs)` runs query tokens through the complete MHA
operation: projection, optional Q/K normalization, RoPE, an optional K/V cache
update, scaled dot-product attention, and output projection. Self-attention
updates and attends to the streaming rolling K/V cache, while cross-attention
attends to the context cache returned by `compute_kv` without updating it.

The caller owns the `BlockKVCache` lifecycle for streaming self-attention:
`before_update(chunk_idx)`, `forward`, then `after_update(chunk_idx)`. The
current query chunk writes its K/V into the rolling cache before it is queried.
Cross-attention instead calls `compute_kv` once for static context and reuses
the finalized cache without rolling-cache update bookkeeping.

For example, assume a model adapter has constructed concrete `self_attention`
and `cross_attention` modules and allocated `self_kv_cache` for the streaming
window:

```python
# B: flattened batch size; L: query-chunk length; S: context/cache length.
# H: number of heads; d: head dimension; C_Q/C_C: query/context width.

# Streaming self-attention updates the rolling cache once per query chunk.
# query_chunks[i]: [..., L, C_Q].
# query_rope_freqs[i]: [R, 1, 1, d], or None when RoPE is disabled. R = L
# for before-cache RoPE; for after-cache RoPE, R covers the query and all
# visible cache positions.
# self_kv_cache K/V storage: [B, sink_size + window_size, H, d].
self_outputs = []
for chunk_idx, (query, rope_freqs) in enumerate(
    zip(query_chunks, query_rope_freqs, strict=True)
):
    self_kv_cache.before_update(chunk_idx)
    output = self_attention(query, self_kv_cache, rope_freqs)  # [..., L, C_Q].
    self_outputs.append(output)
    self_kv_cache.after_update(chunk_idx)
# self_outputs[i]: [..., L, C_Q].
# Visible cached K/V after each step: [B, S, H, d].

# Cross-attention projects static context once and reuses its cache.
# context: [..., S, C_C].
# context_rope_freqs: [S, 1, 1, d] for before-cache RoPE; otherwise None.
context_kv_cache = cross_attention.compute_kv(context, context_rope_freqs)
# context_kv_cache K/V tensors: [B, S, H, d].
cross_outputs = []
for query, rope_freqs in zip(query_chunks, query_rope_freqs, strict=True):
    # query: [..., L, C_Q]; rope_freqs: [R, 1, 1, d] or None.
    output = cross_attention(query, context_kv_cache, rope_freqs)  # [..., L, C_Q].
    cross_outputs.append(output)
# cross_outputs[i]: [..., L, C_Q].
```

### TorchMultiHeadAttention Reference

`TorchMultiHeadAttention` is the portable PyTorch reference implementation that
conforms to the interface above. It is primarily used as a correctness oracle
for `OptimizedMultiHeadAttention`.

### OptimizedMultiHeadAttention

`OptimizedMultiHeadAttention` is one highly optimized MHA implementation in
`flashdreams.accelerated`. It combines an optional Triton FlashAttention2
kernel, an optional PyTorch cuDNN SDPA backend, an optional native FP8 cuDNN
backend, fine-grained quantization of projections and attention, and several
Q/K/V projection-fusion schedules.

`OptimizedImplConfig` configures the algorithm used for each optimized
component. Except for numerical error introduced by quantization, these choices
do not change the mathematical MHA operation. They change how that operation is
scheduled and executed. It can be viewed as a deliberately small scheduling
DSL, analogous to a simplified Halide schedule.

- `qkv_fusion_option` (`QKVFusionOption`, default `FULL`) controls the projection
  GEMM schedule.

  - `NONE` runs independent Q, K, and V projections.
  - `FUSE_KV` runs Q independently and concatenates the K/V weights into one
    projection. It supports different query and context widths.
  - `FULL` runs one fused QKV projection for streaming self-attention. Static
    context projection still uses the derived fused KV projection. This option
    requires equal query and context widths.

- `sdpa_backend` (`SDPABackend`, default `CUDNN`) selects the non-causal
  scaled-dot-product attention kernel.

  - `CUDNN` uses PyTorch cuDNN SDPA for FP16/BF16 Q, K, and V. When
    `quantized_sdpa=True`, it instead uses the native cuDNN Frontend FP8 graph,
    which requires `nvidia-cudnn-frontend` and must be warmed up before CUDA
    graph capture.
  - `FA2` uses the bundled Triton FlashAttention2 implementation with
    token-major `[B, L, H, D]` queries and `[B, S, H, D]` keys and values.

- `use_tma` (`bool`, default `True`) refines the `FA2` schedule. When enabled,
  the TMA FlashAttention2 kernel is selected only if the device, tensor layout,
  and alignment pass its support check; otherwise execution falls back to the
  pointer-based FlashAttention2 kernel. Setting it to `False` always selects the
  pointer-based kernel. It has no effect on the `CUDNN` backend.

- `quantization` (`QuantizationOption`) controls the precision schedule.

  - `projection` (`torch.dtype | None`, default `None`) quantizes the Q/K/V
    projection GEMMs when set to `torch.float8_e4m3fn`, `torch.float8_e5m2`, or
    `torch.int8`. Weights use one scale per output channel, activations use one
    scale per input slice, and projection results return to the input FP16/BF16
    dtype. The output projection remains in native precision.
  - `quantized_sdpa` (`bool`, default `False`) directly casts Q, K, and V to
    unscaled `torch.float8_e4m3fn`, stores K/V caches in that dtype, and runs the
    selected SDPA backend in FP8. The FA2 path also uses FP8 softmax
    probabilities for the P@V product. This is not an accuracy-preserving
    quantization scheme such as SageAttention3 and can make attention
    inaccurate, so validate quality for each model and workload.

All configurations require CUDA FP16/BF16 inputs, compute capability 9.0 or
newer, and a power-of-two head dimension from 16 through 256.

## Supporting flashdreams.accelerated in an Integration

### Quantization

Use the APIs described in the [Quantization Toolkit](#quantization-toolkit) and
follow its examples directly. `QuantizedNonPersistentLinear` should be used as
the inference-time drop-in replacement for any regular `nn.Linear` layer; the
[quantized forward example](#quantized-forward-example) shows both dynamic and
prequantized activation paths.

### Optimized MHA

`OptimizedMultiHeadAttention` remains a generic interface: it does not know an
integration's checkpoint parameter names, attention geometry, normalization,
or RoPE convention. Each integration provides a thin model adapter and lets the
shared implementation own projection fusion, quantization, K/V cache updates,
and SDPA dispatch.

#### 1. Implement the model adapter

Inherit `OptimizedMultiHeadAttention` separately for each self- or
cross-attention variant that has a different contract. The adapter must:

1. Pass the correct `AttentionType` and architecture-specific `AttentionConfig`
   to `super().__init__`.
2. Construct the Q, K, V, output, Q-norm, and K-norm modules using the exact
   attribute names and bias policy expected by the checkpoint.
3. Implement all six logical properties required by `MultiHeadAttention`.
4. Call `_initialize_derived_weights()` after the canonical checkpoint modules
   exist. This builds nonpersistent fused or quantized execution weights and
   installs the hook that refreshes them after checkpoint loading.

For example, the OmniDreams self-attention adapter in
`integrations_v2/omnidreams/impl/transformer/modules.py` follows this
shape:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

from flashdreams.accelerated.multi_head_attention import (
    AttentionConfig,
    AttentionType,
    QKNormScope,
    RoPEConfig,
    RoPEScope,
    RoPEStyle,
)
from flashdreams.accelerated.multi_head_attention.optimized import (
    OptimizedImplConfig,
    OptimizedMultiHeadAttention,
)


class OptimizedSelfAttention(OptimizedMultiHeadAttention):
    @property
    def query_projection(self) -> nn.Linear:
        return self.q_proj

    @property
    def key_projection(self) -> nn.Linear:
        return self.k_proj

    @property
    def value_projection(self) -> nn.Linear:
        return self.v_proj

    @property
    def output_projection(self) -> nn.Linear:
        return self.output_proj

    @property
    def query_norm(self) -> nn.Module:
        return self.q_norm

    @property
    def key_norm(self) -> nn.Module:
        return self.k_norm

    def __init__(self, optimized_impl_config: OptimizedImplConfig) -> None:
        attention_config = AttentionConfig(
            query_dim=2048,
            context_dim=2048,
            n_heads=16,
            head_dim=128,
            qk_norm_scope=QKNormScope.HEAD,
            qk_norm_eps=1e-6,
            rope_config=RoPEConfig(
                style=RoPEStyle.SPLIT,
                scope=RoPEScope.BEFORE_KV_CACHE,
            ),
        )
        super().__init__(
            attention_type=AttentionType.SELF_ATTENTION,
            attention_config=attention_config,
            optimized_impl_config=optimized_impl_config,
        )

        inner_dim = attention_config.inner_dim
        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(2048, inner_dim, bias=False)
        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(2048, inner_dim, bias=False)
        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(2048, inner_dim, bias=False)
        self.output_proj = nn.Linear(inner_dim, 2048, bias=False)
        self.q_norm = nn.RMSNorm(128, eps=1e-6)
        self.k_norm = nn.RMSNorm(128, eps=1e-6)
        self._initialize_derived_weights()
```

Those values describe OmniDreams self-attention: 2048-wide tokens, 16 heads,
128 features per head, per-head Q/K RMSNorm, and split RoPE applied before the
K/V cache update. Its cross-attention adapter exposes the same six properties
but uses a different architecture policy:

```python
omnidreams_cross_attention_config = AttentionConfig(
    query_dim=2048,
    context_dim=1024,
    n_heads=16,
    head_dim=128,
    qk_norm_scope=QKNormScope.HEAD,
    qk_norm_eps=1e-6,
    rope_config=None,
)
```

Use `nn.Identity` for `query_norm` and `key_norm` when Q/K normalization is
disabled. With `QKNormScope.HEAD`, the RMSNorm width is `head_dim`; with
`QKNormScope.INNER`, it is `n_heads * head_dim`. The optimized base then
provides `allocate_kv_cache`, `compute_kv`, and the complete `forward` path.
Preserve any additional interface required by the integration's existing call
sites; for example, OmniDreams also implements its context-parallel methods.

#### 2. Select the adapter in each model component

Instantiate the optimized adapter at the same point where the original
attention module was constructed. OmniDreams makes this choice independently
for self-attention and cross-attention in every transformer block, then passes
the corresponding `OptimizedImplConfig` into each adapter. The block's forward
and cache lifecycle do not change because both implementations conform to the
same MHA interface.

#### 3. Expose the optimization schedule to higher-level configuration

An integration may hard-code one `OptimizedImplConfig` inside its concrete
adapter. That is valid, but it commits every model component and every hardware
platform to that one schedule. Prefer separate self-attention and
cross-attention fields on the integration's network config:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

from flashdreams.accelerated.multi_head_attention.optimized import (
    OptimizedImplConfig,
    QKVFusionOption,
    SDPABackend,
)


@dataclass
class MyNetworkConfig:
    self_attn_optimized_impl_config: OptimizedImplConfig = field(
        default_factory=lambda: OptimizedImplConfig(
            qkv_fusion_option=QKVFusionOption.FULL,
            sdpa_backend=SDPABackend.FA2,
        )
    )
    cross_attn_optimized_impl_config: OptimizedImplConfig = field(
        default_factory=lambda: OptimizedImplConfig(
            qkv_fusion_option=QKVFusionOption.FUSE_KV,
            sdpa_backend=SDPABackend.FA2,
        )
    )
```

Thread these fields from the network config into every block and then into the
concrete attention adapters. Platform-specific pipeline or runner configs can
override them independently after benchmarking. This is the pattern used by
OmniDreams: its GB300 and RTX PRO 6000 variants select different self-attention
schedules, and the RTX PRO 6000 variant keeps its original cross-attention
implementation. Exposing the schedules at this level avoids baking one
hardware-specific result into the model architecture.

> **Future direction.** FlashDreams should define a more general declarative,
> nested configuration system and scheduling DSL. `OptimizedImplConfig` should
> be refactored into that common DSL, and an autotuning system should be built
> around it to search schedules and replace the current manual performance
> tuning process.

## Running, Testing, and Benchmarking

Run all commands below from the repository root. Config inspection and CPU
tests do not instantiate models. Actual OmniDreams runs and benchmarks require
a supported NVIDIA GPU, access to the model assets, and the appropriate
integration dependencies.

### Run OmniDreams with different runner configs

List every installed runner or inspect a resolved config without loading its
model:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run --help
uv run --python 3.12 --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
    --no-instantiate omnidreams-optimized-gb300
```

The accelerated-relevant runner configs are:

| Runner | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `omnidreams` | Reference OmniDreams implementation. |
| `omnidreams-perf` | Compile and CUDA-graph performance preset. |
| `omnidreams-optimized-gb300` | Optimized MHA schedule selected for GB300. |
| `omnidreams-optimized-rtx-pro-6000` | Optimized MHA schedule selected for RTX PRO 6000. |

For example, run the GB300 preset in `mp4` mode with the bundled example data:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
    omnidreams-optimized-gb300 mp4 \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --scenario.example-data true \
    --scenario.example-data-uuid 239560dc-33d1-11ef-9720-00044bcbccac \
    --scenario.total-blocks 120 \
    --output.fps 30 \
    --output.path outputs/omnidreams-optimized-gb300.mp4
```

Replace the runner name and output path to run a different preset.
Use `--no-instantiate` with any runner name to compare nested pipeline and
attention configs before launching GPU work.

### Run correctness tests

Run the CPU-safe accelerated tests first:

```bash
uv run --project flashdreams --group test pytest \
    flashdreams/tests/accelerated -m ci_cpu
```

On a supported CUDA system, run the optimized MHA, quantization, and Triton
kernel tests with:

```bash
uv run --project flashdreams --group test pytest \
    flashdreams/tests/accelerated -m ci_gpu
```

Validate the OmniDreams adapter/config plumbing and benchmark plotting helpers
on CPU with:

```bash
uv run --project integrations_v2/omnidreams --group test pytest \
    integrations_v2/omnidreams/tests/test_transformer_attention_backend.py \
    -m ci_cpu

uv run --project flashdreams --group test pytest \
    scripts/benchmark/test_common.py -m ci_cpu
```

### Run benchmarks directly with pytest

The benchmarks are manual GPU tests. Run every accelerated quantization and MHA
benchmark directly with:

```bash
uv run --project flashdreams --group test pytest \
    flashdreams/benchmarks/accelerated \
    -p no:manual_marker -m manual --benchmark-only -v
```

For the OmniDreams module, network, and pipeline benchmarks:

```bash
uv run --project integrations_v2/omnidreams --group test pytest \
    integrations_v2/omnidreams/benchmarks \
    -p no:manual_marker -m manual --benchmark-only -v
```

Direct pytest runs print results to the terminal. Add
`--benchmark-json=<path>` when a machine-readable result is required.

### Run the scripts/benchmark workflows

The scripts run pytest-benchmark, save JSON artifacts, and generate comparison
plots. Run an individual benchmark family with:

```bash
./scripts/benchmark/flashdreams/accelerated/quantization/run.sh
./scripts/benchmark/flashdreams/accelerated/multi_head_attention/run.sh
./scripts/benchmark/omnidreams/run.sh
```

Run all default benchmark families, or opt into every supported exhaustive
sweep, with:

```bash
./scripts/benchmark/run_all.sh
FLASHDREAMS_RUN_FULL_BENCHMARK=1 ./scripts/benchmark/run_all.sh
```

Recreate plots from saved default or full-sweep JSON without rerunning GPU
measurements:

```bash
./scripts/benchmark/run_all_plot.sh
FLASHDREAMS_RUN_FULL_BENCHMARK=1 ./scripts/benchmark/run_all_plot.sh
```

Default artifacts are written below `artifacts/benchmark/flashdreams` and
`artifacts/benchmark/omnidreams`; exhaustive-sweep artifacts use a `full`
subdirectory. Record the commit, runner/config, GPU and software stack, warmup
policy, and benchmark JSON when comparing schedules. Results selected on one
platform should not be treated as portable performance claims.
