Waypoint-1.5-1B is Overworld's dense, autoregressive interactive video world
model. FlashDreams integrates the published BF16 checkpoint as an
image-established, keyboard/mouse-controlled V2 application with deterministic
per-action metrics and live WebRTC presentation.

The checkpoint's pinned configuration sets prompt_conditioning to null.
Although the generic upstream APIs accept prompts for other models, this
checkpoint-compatible FlashDreams path has no text encoder or prompt-conditioned
weights and deliberately exposes no prompt argument. In the upstream runtime,
this configuration leaves the prompt encoder uninitialized and calling
``set_prompt`` raises. The pinned safetensors artifact contains 393 tensor keys,
with no keys for prompt or cross-attention modules. Consequently, this model
does not accept a text prompt that can influence its output.

Requirements
------------

- A CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU with BF16 and PyTorch FlexAttention support.
- The FlashDreams path was validated on one NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell
  Workstation Edition. The measured PyTorch peak allocation was 6.061 GiB, but
  this is not a minimum-VRAM guarantee and excludes non-PyTorch process memory.
- The first run downloads the 3.72 GB BF16 Waypoint safetensors file and the
  separate Overworld-Models/taehv1_5 checkpoint into the Hugging Face cache.
- ffmpeg on PATH is required for MP4 output.

Installation
------------

From the FlashDreams repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv sync --package flashdreams-waypoint --inexact

The package includes the model implementation and its Action2V adapter.

Running the model
-----------------

Run the application interactively in a browser:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --no-sync flashdreams-run-v2 action2v-waypoint-1-5-1b \
       --mode webrtc --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8766 \
       -- --seed 464

Open http://127.0.0.1:8766/. Waypoint downloads its pinned default first frame
when ``--first-frame`` is omitted. Arguments before the separator configure the V2
runtime; arguments after it configure Waypoint. To inspect all model arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --no-sync flashdreams-run-v2 action2v-waypoint-1-5-1b -- --help

Model and integration architecture
----------------------------------

The pinned checkpoint configuration and FlashDreams implementation agree on
these model-facing invariants:

- Dense 24-block autoregressive diffusion transformer, width 2048.
- 32 query heads, 16 K/V heads, and a four-times-width feed-forward network.
- One model action is a 32-channel, 32x64 latent frame patchified into 512
  spatial tokens.
- Four rectified-flow Euler evaluations at sigmas 1.0, 0.9, 0.75, and 0.3;
  the terminal 0.0 evaluation commits clean cache state.
- Control conditioning uses 256 button IDs, two mouse-delta values, and one
  ternary wheel value. Control fusion is present every third block.
- Most blocks retain 16 latent actions densely. Blocks 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, and
  23 use a 128-action horizon with every eighth historical action pinned.
- TAEHV encodes four seed RGB frames into one latent action and decodes every
  generated latent action into four RGB frames.

The 128-action global horizon corresponds to 512 presented RGB frames, matching
the context length stated by the upstream model card. FlashDreams presents the
codec's native 1024x512 canvas. The official world_engine client can instead
resize 1280x720 input to that native canvas and resize decoded output back to
1280x720; FlashDreams intentionally omits those extra spatial resamples.

The upstream model card advertises a **1.2B parameter count**. Independently,
the pinned model.safetensors header contains **1,860,823,096 BF16 tensor
elements across 393 tensors** (3,721,694,304 bytes). These are different
published-model versus serialized-checkpoint accounting figures; FlashDreams
reports both rather than relabeling the upstream model.

The package-level design review contains component, class, use-case, and
sequence diagrams:

Measured FlashDreams performance
--------------------------------

The final FlashDreams path was measured on 2026-08-26 using an RTX PRO 6000
Blackwell Workstation Edition (96 GiB), driver 595.84, PyTorch 2.12.1+cu130,
CUDA 13.0, BF16 weights, the pinned validation first frame and control timeline, seed 464,
native 1024x512 output, four denoise evaluations, and synchronous profiling.
Actions 1-19 were warmup; actions 20-40 were the steady-state sample.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 55 45

   * - Measurement
     - Result
   * - Mean action latency
     - 68.791 ms per four generated frames
   * - Median action latency
     - 68.887 ms
   * - p90 action latency
     - 69.737 ms
   * - Throughput derived from mean latency
     - 58.15 generated RGB frames/s
   * - Peak PyTorch CUDA allocation
     - 6.061 GiB
   * - Encoded output
     - 164 frames: 4 seed + 40 actions x 4 frames

The declared 60 FPS is presentation timing, not a throughput guarantee.
Overworld separately reports 56 FPS for its unquantized runtime on an RTX 5090;
that result was not reproduced here and is not directly comparable across
different GPU, runtime, and presentation stacks.

Parity and rollout validation
-----------------------------

FlashDreams loaded the same BF16 checkpoint and matched the pinned official
world_engine implementation through one complete controlled action. The final
comparison includes the four-step Euler solve and both cache commits:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 20 20 20

   * - Comparison
     - Mean absolute error
     - Max absolute error
     - Cosine similarity
   * - Seed cache flow
     - 0.010793
     - 0.218750
     - 0.999586
   * - Clean latent after four steps
     - 0.005682
     - 0.033691
     - 0.999869
   * - Final cache flow
     - 0.010511
     - 0.265625
     - 0.999487

The residual is consistent with BF16 execution through different compiled
kernel boundaries. Review optimizations retained a byte-identical 40-action
MP4. Additional inference completed 15 distinct scenes at 40 actions each and
one 118-action rollout: 718 generated actions and 2,936 decoded frames in total,
with complete finite metrics and exact frame accounting. This demonstrates
execution, cache longevity, and scene coverage; it is not a qualitative
gameplay or physical-accuracy score.

Intended use and limitations
----------------------------

Waypoint is suitable for research and prototyping around interactive video
worlds, creative exploration, control-conditioned generation, and low-latency
world-model systems. It is a generative model, not a physically grounded
simulator.

Important limitations:

- Long rollouts can drift, collapse, or become inconsistent.
- Geometry, motion, object identity, and persistence can be unstable.
- Outputs may reflect biases or unsafe patterns learned from training data.
- The FlashDreams integration has no content-safety filter of its own.
- It is not appropriate for safety-critical decisions, surveillance,
  high-stakes automation, or deployments that remove reasonable safeguards.
- The current server accepts one WebRTC browser client per process. Multiple
  sessions may share model weights, but model execution is serialized.
- Live results depend on browser event timing and are not reproducible from the
  application command line alone.
