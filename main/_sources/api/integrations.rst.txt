Pipelines, runners, and applications
====================================

FlashDreams model integrations use these public layers:

- **Pipelines** (``StreamInferencePipelineConfig``) that define model behavior.
- **Runners** (``RunnerConfig`` + ``Runner``) that define CLI-facing I/O.
- **V2 applications** (``IApplication``) that bind reusable demo infrastructure
  directly to pipeline configs.

Most actively developed model implementations now live under
``integrations_v2/<name>/`` as plugin-style standalone packages. This page
keeps documenting the in-tree pipeline modules that are still exposed from
``flashdreams.recipes``.

.. note::

   Pipeline modules import the heavy GPU stack (transformer-engine, CUDA
   ops) at import time, so this page shows them by *automodule* with
   ``:no-undoc-members:`` to keep the rendered API focused on the names
   that these in-tree modules actually expose.

Integration structure (current)
-------------------------------

V2 demo ports follow ``integrations_v2/<name>/``:

- ``apps/<demo>/adapter.py``: ``create_app() -> IApplication`` binding.
- ``config.py``: the model's unique pipeline config literal or model-specific
  ``StreamInferencePipelineConfig`` wrapper.
- ``impl/``: all model-specific implementation.
- ``tests/``: model-specific tests, when needed.
- ``apps/<demo>/README.md``: launch instructions for that demo.
- ``pyproject.toml``: packaging plus ``flashdreams.applications_v2`` entry points.

Apart from that unique config, the integration root contains no implementation
modules. These packages do not add ``runner.py`` or
``flashdreams.runner_configs`` just to launch a v2 demo.

The default application entry point uses
``<demo-slug>-<model-slug>`` and ``create_app``. Additional compatible
configurations may use ``<demo-slug>-<model-slug>-<suffix>`` and the matching
``create_app_<suffix>`` factory, such as a ``-fast`` entry point backed by
``create_app_fast``.

NVIDIA OmniDreams
-----------------

OmniDreams ships under ``integrations_v2/omnidreams``. Its model code lives
under ``impl/`` and its application adapter binds the reusable
``interactive-drive`` package under ``apps/`` through the
``flashdreams.applications_v2`` entry-point group. See
``integrations_v2/omnidreams/README.md`` for launch details.
