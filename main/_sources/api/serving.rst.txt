Serving
===================================

Serving in FlashDreams is integration-driven at the model/runtime layer, while
WebRTC provides the shared browser-facing transport for realtime demos.

Serving building blocks
-----------------------

- **Runner config** defines serving-relevant I/O fields (prompts, control
  tensors, image paths, output transport).
- **Pipeline** manages model lifecycle and cached state across steps.
- **Shared WebRTC transport** handles browser session I/O, request routing,
  data-channel controls, and media responses for realtime demos.
- **Integration runtime** owns model-specific checkpoint setup, conditioning,
  prompt/scene semantics, and chunk generation.

Reference integration
---------------------

The reusable applications provide concrete examples of the shared serving stack:

- shared transport code under ``flashdreams/flashdreams/serving/webrtc/``,
- camera-to-video application behavior under ``apps/cam2v/``,
- thin model bindings under ``integrations_v2/<model>/apps/cam2v/adapter.py``,
- OmniDreams model wiring under ``integrations_v2/omnidreams/`` and serving
  under ``apps/interactive_drive/``.

Launch patterns
---------------

Single GPU:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run flashdreams-run-v2 cam2v-lingbot \
       --mode webrtc -- --example-data --total-blocks 21

Multi GPU:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 --no-python flashdreams-run-v2 \
       cam2v-lingbot --mode webrtc -- --example-data --total-blocks 21
