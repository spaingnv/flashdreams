The machinery that runs a v2 application: it finds one, asks it for a session,
runs that session's two loops on two threads, and delivers what they generate to
a file or a browser.

This is the implementation. For how the pieces fit together and why the seams are
where they are, read [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md) first; for the
protocols an application implements, see [`api_v2`](../api_v2/README.md).

## Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Latent frame** | One temporal slice in the model's latent representation. It is not yet an RGB or RGBA image; decoding may produce one or more model frames from it. |
| **AR step** or **AR chunk** | One autoregressive model iteration and the group of latent frames it produces. A chunk commonly contains four or eight latent frames, but the size is integration-specific. |
| **Model frame** | One decoded RGB or RGBA image produced by the model, before UI composition. A model step may return several model frames together. |
| **Frame** or **presented frame** | One model frame after the UI loop has composited its widgets or overlays. This is the frame written to a client window or output sink. |

## What is in here

Finding and starting an application:

- `application_registry.py` reads the `flashdreams.applications_v2` entry points
  to turn a slug into an `IApplication`, falling back to importing the slug as a
  module name.
- `cli.py` is `flashdreams-run-v2`: it splits its own arguments from the
  application's at `--`, decides which session to ask for, and builds the window.
- `application_runner.py` owns the application lifecycle around one run —
  `init`, `create_session`, `run_session`, `close`.
- `client_window_factory.py` turns `--mode` into a window, and owns the
  arguments each mode takes.

Running a session:

- `session_runner.py` is `run_session`, which everything above ends up calling.
  It is the only place that starts a generation thread; the WebRTC server and
  the video encoder run threads of their own, but neither touches a loop.
- `event_buffer.py` holds client input until both loops have read it.
- `presentation_manager.py` buffers generated frames between the two threads and
  decides which one the UI sees.
- `session_desc.py` describes the session being run: frame size, rates, layout,
  and the two policy knobs below.
- `step_result.py` is what one generation step produces.

Presenting it:

- `blit_model_output_to_screen_loop.py` is the UI loop a session gets when it
  registers none of its own.
- `slangpy_ui_loop.py` and `slangpy_ui_renderer.py` provide retained SlangPy
  widgets over the model output. `imgui_ui_loop.py` and `imgui_ui_renderer.py`
  provide immediate Dear ImGui controls rendered through SlangPy.
- `mp4_client_window.py` and `webrtc_client_window.py` are the two windows.
- `mp4_output_sink.py`, `metrics_output_sink.py`, `video_encoder.py` and
  `video_tensor.py` are what output is written through.
- `serving/` is the HTTP and WebRTC server behind the browser window.

Input:

- `user_input_event.py` defines the concrete event types, `user_input_events.py` the
  batch of them a source hands over.
- `input_timeline.py` advances modality-neutral, fixed-rate input windows and
  catches a stale model clock up to newly accepted input.
- `keyboard_input.py` buffers keyboard edges independently of that clock and
  projects held state over each selected window. Other modalities should reuse
  the window clock with their own semantics: held state for mouse buttons,
  coalesced position for pointer motion, and accumulated impulses for wheels.

## The command line

`flashdreams-run-v2 SLUG` finds an application through the
`flashdreams.applications_v2` entry point group and runs it with
`ApplicationRunner`. Arguments after `--` go to the application, so
`flashdreams-run-v2 SLUG -- --help` describes the application rather than this
command. The split is stated rather than guessed because an application may
declare arguments this command also has.

`--mode` picks where the run goes, and each mode owns its own arguments in
`client_window_factory.py`:

| Mode | Takes | Input | Ends when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mp4` (default) | `--output-path` | none | the application UI finishes |
| `webrtc` | `--host`, `--port` | keyboard, mouse, focus, reset, close | the application UI finishes or the client closes it |

These override whatever session the application asked for:

| Argument | Sets |
| --- | --- |
| `--pixel-width`, `--pixel-height` | Frame size to generate. |
| `--fps` | `frames_per_second_for_step`, which is also the rate an MP4 plays back at. |
| `--layout` | Tensor layout to generate results in. |
| `--backpressure-mode` | What the model thread does when the presentation queue is full. |
| `--presentation-mode` | Whether the UI runs continuously or only for newly selected model frames. |

Each defaults to asking for nothing, so a run that names none of them gets what
the application generates. There is no argument for the UI tick rate, and none
for `run_session`'s `steps` limit — a caller that needs to bound a run by steps
drives the runtime from Python.

`--timeout SECONDS` bounds the whole application run, including initialization
and replacement sessions. At the deadline the UI thread signals the session's
loops to stop and performs their normal cleanup. An in-flight model step must
return before the process can finish cleaning up. Synchronous application or
session initialization likewise cannot be interrupted mid-call.

`--stats-path` adds a `MetricsOutputSink`. It receives the **model** loop's
results as they are published, not the UI loop's output, so a benchmark measures
what the model generated while the window still sees one composited frame per
tick. See [`configs/v2_model_benchmarks.json`](../../../configs/v2_model_benchmarks.json)
and the [benchmark README](../../tools/benchmarks/README.md) for the suite.
The runtime augments those model records with step wall time and
presentation-queue depth/publish-wait measurements under the reserved
`runtime_` metric prefix. UI and window timings are not folded into a later
model record because they describe a different frame.

`--stats-path` also sets `FLASHDREAMS_SYNC_AND_PROFILE=1` before constructing the
application, enabling synchronized per-stage pipeline profiling for the run.

## Starting and stopping a run

`ApplicationRunner.run` calls `init`, `create_session` and `run_session` in
order, and closes the application on the way out whether or not the run
succeeded. It also closes the window itself when the run never started, because
`run_session` is what otherwise owns the window, and a WebRTC window may already
be serving a browser before the application has finished loading.

`run_session` then opens the window and any metrics sink, collects one batch of
input, presents one tick, and only then starts the model thread — so a client that
closed during startup is never generated for. Its main loop services input and
presents frames until the shutdown event is set, or until the model thread has
finished and no frames are still pending.

On the way out it sets the shutdown event, joins the model thread, shuts both
loops down, clears the presentation buffer, unregisters the readers, closes every
sink it opened, and closes the session. Then it raises a loop's failure if one
was queued, otherwise its own, otherwise the first cleanup failure, logging the
rest.

## `EventBuffer`

Input arrives once per tick on the UI thread and is appended here. The buffer
keeps a flat list plus a cursor per registered reader: `read` returns everything
that reader has not seen and moves its cursor to the end, and
`collect_garbage` deletes the prefix every reader has passed. The UI loop is
reader 0 and the model loop is reader 1.

Appending also counts resets. Every `ResetUserInputEvent` in a batch bumps
the generation number that loops and the presentation manager compare against
their own.

A close event is handled twice over, deliberately: `run_session` sets the
shutdown event when it sees one in a collected batch, and `ILoop._begin_run` sets
it again when a loop reads one. Either path alone would end the run; both means
neither thread waits on the other to notice.

## `PresentationManager`

The model thread publishes a list of channels per step into a bounded chunk
queue. The queue holds one pending chunk by default. Once the UI thread takes
that chunk, its remaining frames live in the active presented chunk rather than
the queue; an empty queue with an active chunk means presentation is keeping up.

`publish` observes complete model-step timing for cadence, including any
post-processing performed inside the step. The UI thread calls `advance` once
per tick so the manager can decide whether the next presentable model frame is
due. A full pending queue applies the configured backpressure policy without
bypassing frame pacing.

When CUDA is available, the default `PresentationManager` creates a stream at
the device's highest available priority. `run_session` keeps that one stream
current for the entire UI-thread lifecycle, including session and window
initialization, input collection, UI rendering, window writes, and cleanup.
Constructing the manager with an explicit CPU device disables the CUDA stream.
Stream priority lets short UI work overtake queued lower-priority kernels, but
does not preempt a kernel that is already executing.

Frame cadence initially uses `frames_per_second_for_step`, then follows the
throughput of complete model steps over the trailing two seconds. The estimate
uses time spent inside model steps, so presentation-queue backpressure cannot
feed back into a progressively slower cadence. A late UI tick reanchors the next
deadline; it never drains multiple model frames into back-to-back writes in one
tick.

`SessionDesc.backpressure_mode` decides what publishing does when the queue is
full:

- `BLOCK` waits for room, in `put_timeout` slices so a shutdown is still
  noticed. Every generated frame survives, and the model thread is held back to
  the rate the UI can consume.
- `DROP_OLDEST` evicts queued work so the UI can catch up to the newest output,
  trading frames for latency.

`SessionDesc.presentation_mode` decides what the UI does when no new frame is
ready:

- `CONTINUOUS` runs the UI loop every tick while inference is active,
  re-presenting the newest model frame when necessary.
- `ON_DEMAND` runs the UI loop only when `advance` moves to a new model frame.

While inference has not started or has finished, an unfinished UI runs every
tick in either mode. The model loop owns `inference_state`; the UI can query it
through `model_inference_state`. The UI remains active after model output drains
and may use `is_finished` to declare its own terminal condition.

For output that has to be compared frame by frame, use `BLOCK` with
`ON_DEMAND`: together they keep every frame in the presentation manager
and present each exactly once in order. Chunks that could not be kept are counted
in `dropped_for_space` and `discarded_at_reset`, and logged when the run ends.
Both counters use model chunks as their unit.

## Presenting and writing

A UI loop reads model frames through `presented_model_frame` and
`presented_model_frames`, composites whatever it wants, and returns one
`StepResult` that `run_session` writes to the window.

The ImGui and SlangPy UI loops prepare the optional model back buffer before
composition: integer `[0, 255]` frames are normalized to the renderer's
floating-point range, frames are moved to the renderer's device, and dimensions
are resized to the rendered overlay. `PresentationManager.composite` then
enforces matching dimensions and device instead of silently repairing them.

The default UI loop, `BlitModelOutputToScreenLoop`, composites every model
channel in list order as if they were image layers and reshapes the result into
the session's layout.

`SlangPyUILoop` is the alternative for SlangPy's retained
widget subset. `ImGuiUILoop` exposes the complete ImGui API. Both return a `[1, C, H, W]` frame, so an `ISession` using either should declare a `tchw` output layout.

`IClientWindow` is both an `InputSource` and an `OutputSink`, so a window is
written to with the same three calls as any sink: `open` with the session
description, `write` per result, `close` at the end. Both windows are thin
delegates over the thing that does the work — `Mp4ClientWindow` over
`Mp4OutputSink`, `WebRTCClientWindow` over `WebRTCServer` — and neither describes
the output shape, because the session already did.

They differ in what they can do rather than in how they are driven. A session
chooses its UI independently of the client window. Browser keyboard, mouse and
focus events arrive on the server's own thread, so it queues them and hands them
over in batches when the session asks.

A UI loop may call `request_new_session(session_desc)` during its step with a
fully resolved replacement description. `run_session` stops and cleans the
current session, leaves the interactive window open, and returns that
description unchanged. `ApplicationRunner` creates the replacement from it. A
WebRTC browser disconnect releases only its peer connection, so refreshing the
page does not stop the session, server, or application.

The UI thread owns WebRTC cadence. Each `write` synchronously materializes one
owned video frame and admits it to a two-frame FIFO of unsent frames. The WebRTC
track returns queued frames to aiortc immediately: it neither sleeps to pace
them nor repeats the latest frame. If network or encoder congestion fills the
FIFO, the next write replaces only its oldest unsent frame; a frame already
handed to aiortc is never overwritten.

When a replacement session reopens the WebRTC window, it keeps the existing
peer connection and discards frames still queued from the previous session. A
replacement must keep the negotiated layout, frame rates, width, and height.

What a sink expects of the pixel values it is handed is part of the result
contract, in [`api_v2`](../api_v2/README.md#what-a-step-returns).

## Adding a mode

A mode is one way to watch a run. Subclass `ClientWindowMode` in
`client_window_factory.py`, declare the arguments only it takes, and add it to
`_MODES`; a command line offering the modes never has to know what any of them
are. `check_arguments` is called while the command can still print usage, and
`starting` and `finished` are what it prints — which is how a WebRTC run reports
a URL nobody could have guessed when the port was chosen by the operating system.
